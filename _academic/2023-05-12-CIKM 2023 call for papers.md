**Details**: https://uobevents.eventsair.com/cikm2023/2023-cikm-calls

The Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM) provides an international forum for presentation and discussion of research on information and knowledge management, as well as recent advances on data and knowledge bases. The purpose of the conference is to identify challenging problems facing the development of future knowledge and information systems, and to shape future directions of research by soliciting and reviewing high quality, applied and theoretical research findings. An important part of the conference is the Workshops program which focuses on timely research challenges and initiatives. CIKM has a strong tradition of workshops devoted to emerging areas of database management, IR, and related fields.
